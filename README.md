ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction Web App
This is a simple web-based machine learning project that predicts whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on medical input parameters. It uses Flask for the backend, Scikit-learn for building the ML model, and Bootstrap for a responsive frontend UI.

ðŸ§° Tech Stack
Python â€“ Backend logic and data processing

Flask â€“ Lightweight web framework for serving the app

Scikit-learn â€“ Used to build and train the diabetes prediction model

Pandas & NumPy â€“ For data loading, preprocessing, and manipulation

HTML/CSS â€“ For structuring and styling the frontend

Bootstrap â€“ For a responsive and modern UI design

ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which includes health-related attributes such as:

Pregnancies

Glucose

Blood Pressure

Skin Thickness

Insulin

BMI

Diabetes Pedigree Function

Age

The target column indicates whether the person has diabetes (1) or not (0).
